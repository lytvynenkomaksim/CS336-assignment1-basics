Once upon a time, there was a reliable otter named Ollie. He lived in a river with his family. They all loved to play and swim together.
One day, Ollie's mom said, "Ollie, hurry and get some fish for dinner!" Ollie swam fast to catch fish. He saw his friend, the duck. "Hi, Ollie!" said the duck. "Hi, duck!" said Ollie. "I need to hurry and catch fish for my family."
While Ollie was catching fish, he found a big shiny stone. He thought, "This is not a fish, but it is so pretty!" Ollie took the shiny stone home to show his family. They all looked at the shiny stone and smiled. The shiny stone made everyone happy, and they forgot about the fish for dinner.
